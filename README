Explanation of the files:

a) part1.py : feature extraction (getting histogram and HOG as features)
b) part2a.py : doing KNN classification on CIFAR-10 dataset without using inbuilt function ( very slow!)
c) part2b.py : doing KNN classification on CIFAR-10 dataset using KNeighborsClassifier function from sklearn library.
d) part3.py :  Visualize the NN classification using PCA

The code also experiments with different values of k during KNN classification
